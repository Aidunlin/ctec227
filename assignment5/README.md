# Coding Assignment 5

Using PHP, write SQL queries to do the following using the IdeaJam database you created earlier in this module. Use what you learned in this module and in CTEC 127 to complete the assignment.

Use your creativity to decide how you will show the results on your PHP page. You may also want to create separate pages for each task. I will leave this up to you.

## Task 0

Access the empty repository for this assignment.

Clone the repository to your computer and open it up in Visual Studio Code.

## Task No. 1

Show all comments for an idea where the idea.idea_id = 4

## Task No. 2

Modify the query above to include the idea.description, idea.user_id, comment.comment 

## Task No. 3

Show all tags for an idea.idea_id = 4 and include the idea_tag.tag_id

## Task No. 4

Show all tags for an idea.idea_id = 4 and include the idea_tag.tag_id and the tag.tag (this will require two joins). Order the results by the tag.tag column

## Task No. 5

Show all of the user info for idea.idea_id = 1. Include the user.first_name, user.last_name, user.username

## Task No. 6

List idea.description, idea.user_id, comment.comment, user.first_name, user.last_name where idea.idea_id=1

Try this now for other IDs
